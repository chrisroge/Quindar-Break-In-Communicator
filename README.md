## What is a Quindar Tone?

Quindar tones are beep tones that were used in NASA communications to signal when the ground-to-air radio link was activated. This implementation uses a 2500 Hz tone for 500ms with radio static before and after the beep.

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. **Choose your TTS provider** in `.env`:

### Edge TTS (Default - Free)
```env
DEFAULT_TTS=EDGE
EDGE_VOICE=en-US-AndrewNeural
```
- **No API key required**
- Uses Microsoft Edge TTS (free service)
- Excellent quality neural voices
- See available voices: `edge-tts --list-voices`
- Requires: `pip install edge-tts`

### OpenAI TTS (Premium)
```env
DEFAULT_TTS=OPENAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```
- Requires OpenAI API key
- Supports `instructions` parameter for voice personalization
- Uses OpenAI's premium TTS voices

## Running the Application

```bash
cargo run
```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:42069`

## Usage

### Basic Request

Send a POST request to the `/play` endpoint with JSON containing your text:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:42069/play \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "Hello, this is a test message"}'
```

This uses the default TTS provider configured in your `.env` file.

### Voice Options

**Voice options depend on your TTS provider:**

#### Using Edge TTS (Default - Free)

Specify any Edge TTS voice name. Use `edge-tts --list-voices` to see all 100+ options.

**Popular English voices:**
```bash
# Male voices
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:42069/play \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "text": "Testing Edge TTS male voice",
    "voice": "en-US-AndrewNeural"
  }'

# Female voices
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:42069/play \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "text": "Testing Edge TTS female voice",
    "voice": "en-US-AriaNeural"
  }'
```

**Common Edge TTS voices:**
- `en-US-AndrewNeural` - Confident, warm male (default)
- `en-US-AriaNeural` - Professional female
- `en-US-GuyNeural` - Clear male
- `en-US-JennyNeural` - Friendly female
- `en-GB-RyanNeural` - British male
- `en-GB-SoniaNeural` - British female

**Or omit the `voice` parameter** to use your `EDGE_VOICE` from `.env`

#### Using OpenAI TTS (Premium)

If you set `DEFAULT_TTS=OPENAI`, use one of these 6 voices:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:42069/play \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "text": "Testing OpenAI TTS",
    "voice": "echo"
  }'
```

**OpenAI voices:** `alloy`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, `shimmer`

| Voice | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `alloy` | Neutral, balanced |
| `echo` | Clear, authoritative male |
| `fable` | Warm, expressive |
| `onyx` | Deep, rich male |
| `nova` | Friendly female |
| `shimmer` | Bright, energetic female |

### Voice Personalization

Control playback with optional parameters:

#### Available for Both Providers (Edge TTS + OpenAI)

- **`speed`**: Playback speed from 0.25 (very slow) to 4.0 (very fast), default 1.0
- **`volume`**: Volume gain from 0.1 (very quiet) to 5.0 (very loud), default 2.0

```bash
# Works with both Edge TTS and OpenAI
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:42069/play \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "text": "This is an urgent alert!",
    "voice": "en-US-AndrewNeural",
    "speed": 1.15,
    "volume": 2.5
  }'
```

#### OpenAI Only

- **`instructions`**: Guide how the voice should deliver the text (e.g., "Speak with urgency")

```bash
# Only works with DEFAULT_TTS=OPENAI
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:42069/play \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "text": "Critical system alert",
    "voice": "shimmer",
    "instructions": "Speak with urgency and concern",
    "speed": 1.15,
    "volume": 2.5
  }'
```

**Note:** If you use `instructions` with Edge TTS, it will be ignored (with a log message).

See [Quindar-Break-In-Developer_guide.md](Quindar-Break-In-Developer_guide.md) for detailed examples and recommendations.

### Audio Sequence

Every request plays this authentic sequence:

1. **TTS generation** - Voice requested from your configured TTS provider (starts buffering immediately)
2. **Mic pop** - Subtle microphone activation sound
3. **Radio static** (200ms) - Plays while TTS is buffering in background
4. **Opening Quindar tone** (2500 Hz beep, 500ms) - Once TTS is fully buffered
5. **Post-transmission static** (200ms)
6. **Your voice message** - Plays with no delay!
7. **Closing Quindar tone** (2500 Hz beep, 250ms - shorter)
8. **Transmission complete**

This approach eliminates any awkward pause between the tone and voice by buffering the TTS during the pre-transmission static.

### Request Queuing

Multiple requests are automatically queued and played sequentially - no overlapping audio! You can send multiple requests rapidly and they will play one after another in order:

```bash
# Send multiple messages - they'll queue up automatically
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:42069/play -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text": "First message"}' &
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:42069/play -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text": "Second message"}' &
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:42069/play -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text": "Third message"}' &
```

Each request returns immediately while a background worker processes them one at a time.

## Example Messages
